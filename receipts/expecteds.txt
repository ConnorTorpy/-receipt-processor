receipt 6 attempts to break the rounding by having multiple of 3 description items with costs that are multiples of 5
receipt 7 attempts to break the system with a retailer description of over 4k characters
receipt 8 has a large quantity of items that need their price *.2 added
receipt 9 has a retailer with a large quantity of non-alphanumeric characters and items whose description would be a multiple of 3
if the trim is not done properly
receipt 10 is very similar to receipt 3 except all items have had all normal characters replaced with random garbage and large numbers of
spaces added to the front and end of each item as well as some non alphanumeric characters added to the retailer
receipt 11 attempts to break the system with 1 character names for items and retailer

11 test cases so that all can be posted at once which will have forced a resize and cause incorrect return results if
